## Wordle Clone

### Introduction
Wordle is a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a five-letter word by submitting guesses and receiving feedback on each letter's correctness. This clone replicates the gameplay mechanics of the original Wordle game using JavaScript.

### Game Features
- Players attempt to guess a five-letter word.
- Feedback is provided for each letter: correct, incorrect, or in the correct position.
- Limited attempts are allowed.
- Game over when all attempts are used or the word is correctly guessed.

### Application Structure
- **HTML**: Contains the structure of the game board and keyboard.
- **CSS**: Styles the game interface for better user experience.

### Technical Details
- **Fetching Target Word**: The game fetches a random five-letter word from an API upon window load.
- **Game Board**: The board displays the letters of the word being guessed.
- **Keyboard**: Allows players to input letters for their guesses.
- **Handling Key Presses**: Listens for physical keyboard presses and maps them to actions such as adding a letter, removing a letter, or submitting a guess.
- **Checking Word Validity**: Validates the guessed word using a dictionary API to ensure it exists in the English language.
- **Managing Game State**: Tracks the current attempt, target word, and game over status.

### Possible Improvements
